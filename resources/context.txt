Bahia is a Brazilian state located in the Northeast Region. The population of Bahia is 14.9 million inhabitants, the fourth largest in Brazil. The municipality of Salvador is the state capital and also served as the first Brazilian capital between 1549 and 1763. The state's geography is characterized by plains and depressions, as well as two dominant climate types, tropical and semi-arid. Bahia's economy is the main one in the Northeast and focuses on the tertiary sector and the manufacturing industry.
Bahia climate Two climate types are predominant in Bahia. The first is the semi-arid, which occurs in the central region (with the exception of the highest areas) and part of the west of the state. This climate is characterized by high temperatures and low relative humidity, with irregular precipitation and a dry period generally in the winter months. Rainfall is concentrated in the summer, with an annual average of around 800 mm. The tropical climate occurs mainly in the east of Bahia, also marked by high annual temperatures and a higher level of humidity, especially on the coast. Average annual precipitation varies between 1,200 and 1,600 mm. In some coastal cities, this value can exceed 2,000 mm.
Relief of Bahia Plateaus and depressions are the predominant forms of relief in Bahia, which gives most of the state elevations above 300 meters. The west of Bahia and part of the north are part of the Depression Sertaneja and São Francisco, to the east of which the Plateaus and Serras do Leste-Sudeste extend. The highest terrain in the state is located in this domain, with emphasis on Serra do Espinhaço and Chapada Diamantina. This is where the highest point of Bahia and the Northeast is located: Pico do Barbado, 2,033 meters above sea level. In the eastern range, finally, we have the Coastal Plains and Tablelands.
