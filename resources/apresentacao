Hey guys! Nice to meet you, I am The Home-Environment Technolohical-Agent, but those closest to me call me Theta,

I am an autonomous robot for domestic services developed by the @Home team of the Academic League of Robotics at the Federal University of Pelotas,

To perform tasks such as: mapping, navigation, self-location, skeleton tracking, detection and recognition of people and objects, in addition to human-robot interaction, I am equipped with a range of sensors and processing devices, such as: kinect, lidar, cameras, nuke, speakers, microphone and encoders.
Furthermore, as you can see, my base is a motorized and motivated wheelchair provided by Freedom, contributing to the union of service robotics with accessibility services,

The team maintains my constant development and updating by promoting robotics at the university and inspiring research in the areas of computing, electronics, control and automation,

Now, I'll let my developers tell you a little more about our team! Thank you for coming to meet me at the Integrated Control, Automation and Electronics Week. See you later!
